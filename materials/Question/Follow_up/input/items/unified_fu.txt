<li>In your response to the previous problem, you said that ${e://Field/ppv_response_0} of those with a positive ${e://Field/positive_test_result_0} actually have the medical condition (${e://Field/medical_condition_0}).</li></ul>

Imagine a woman you care about participated in a routine screening to detect a medical condition (${e://Field/medical_condition_0}) as the one you saw before, and receives a positive ${e://Field/positive_test_result_0}.

The doctor offers her a follow-up test ${e://Field/doctor_offers_0}, necessary to confirm the diagnosis. During the procedure, a needle is inserted to take a sample of ${e://Field/fluid_test_0}.
